<p>This page is a list of subprojects inside the Nemerle project we would&#xD;
like to have done but do not have enough resources to implement ourselves.&#xD;</p>

<p>If you don't know Nemerle already (but you have some programming&#xD;
experience) -- don't worry, learning Nemerle won't take you more then&#xD;
a few days and you can learn more as you go with the project.&#xD;</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="MSc_thesis"><a name="MSc_thesis" id="MSc_thesis">MSc thesis?</a></span></h3>

<p>Most of the topics here are possible to be taken as MSc thesis subject&#xD;
in The Computer Science Institute, University of Wroclaw. &#xD;
It is probably also possible to take this as a thesis subject outside our&#xD;
institute. In both cases you should set this thing up with your advisor.&#xD;</p>

<p>If you want to pick one of these, please contact us so no project is&#xD;
done by more than one student (we will be the locking device here :-).&#xD;</p>

<p>We (the Nemerle team) will be happy to evaluate results of these projects&#xD;
to help the advisor.&#xD;</p>

<p>It is also possible to take some other project, not listed here. Especially&#xD;
developing macro packages could be both interesting (from the programming&#xD;
language design point of view) and practical.&#xD;</p>

<p>Time estimations are based on 40h/week of programming work.&#xD;</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Open_projects"><a name="Open_projects" id="Open_projects">Open projects</a></span></h2>

<p>You are welcome to take any of them.&#xD;</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Code_completion_engine"><a name="Code_completion_engine" id="Code_completion_engine">Code completion engine</a></span></h3>

<p>Most modern IDEs provide some kind of code completion.&#xD;</p>

<p>For example when you write <code>System.Console.Wr</code> a window is&#xD;
popped listing <code>WriteLine</code> and <code>Write</code> overloads. This&#xD;
is relatively easy -- because this can be done with only very local&#xD;
knowledge of the existing file.&#xD;</p>

<p>Next there is <code>def x = System.Console.Out; x.Wr</code>. This is somewhat&#xD;
harder, because you need to know about local variables.&#xD;</p>

<p>Somewhat orthogonal issue is to collect and maintain information about&#xD;
classes and their members in the current project. This information needs&#xD;
to be updated as the user edits the sources.&#xD;</p>

<p>To summarize:&#xD;
</p><ul><li>static member completion&#xD;
</li><li>instance member completion&#xD;
</li><li>class information collection&#xD;
</li></ul> &#xD;
The second and third case requires close interaction with the compiler --&#xD;
for example it would be hard to write stand alone parser, because of macros&#xD;
that provide syntax extensions (that need to be understood by the code&#xD;
completion engine).&#xD;

<p>The first two cases can be tested with nemish (Nemerle Interactive Shell).&#xD;
For the third case you would either need to extend one of the existing plugins&#xD;
for MonoDevelop, VS.NET, SharpDevelop or Asper or alternatively create&#xD;
a simple editor with code completion (this isn't very hard for example&#xD;
using GTK Source View).&#xD;</p>

<p><b>Time estimate</b>: 2 weeks or more depending on problems for the first two&#xD;
cases, 1 week or more for the third case, +1 week for plugin extension/editor&#xD;
writing.&#xD;</p>

<p><b>Requirements</b>: strong ability to dive into existing code base, extend it&#xD;
and debug, ability to communicate with Nemerle team members.&#xD;</p>

<p><b>Status</b>: Alejandro Serrano has declared to work on it, using both MonoDevelop and SharpDevelop as the preferred IDEs. Check <a class="internal absent" href="/the-code-completion-page.html">Code_Completion</a> for details and progress,&#xD;</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Optimizations"><a name="Optimizations" id="Optimizations">Optimizations</a></span></h3>

<p>Compilation is usually based on rewriting abstract syntax trees (AST) &#xD;
The tree used internally in Nemerle is now ready to incorporate some optimization pass. There are several things we would like to have done.&#xD;</p>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Traditional_optimizations"><a name="Traditional_optimizations" id="Traditional_optimizations">Traditional optimizations</a></span></h4>

<p>Copy propagation, constant propagation, stack slot reuse.  Not very&#xD;
much to be done here -- we leave more machine specific stuff (strength&#xD;
reduction etc) for the JIT. What we would like here is to simplify and&#xD;
shorten generated code, so JIT time is shortened and the generated code&#xD;
becomes more readable.&#xD;</p>

<p>This may require some investigation about what kind of optimizations&#xD;
are performed by the JIT.&#xD;</p>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Killing_allocations"><a name="Killing_allocations" id="Killing_allocations">Killing allocations</a></span></h4>

<p>There are several places where we allocate more than we could. Some more&#xD;
optimizations are possible for example in closure conversion and tuple&#xD;
construction/matching.&#xD;</p>

<p><b>Time estimate</b>: about 2 weeks for each.&#xD;</p>

<p><b>Requirements</b>: some ability to dive into existing Nemerle code base,&#xD;
basic knowledge about compiler optimizations (can be gained during the project&#xD;
though, it isn't very hard).&#xD;</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Design_by_contract_and_assertion_macros"><a name="Design_by_contract_and_assertion_macros" id="Design_by_contract_and_assertion_macros">Design by contract and assertion macros</a></span></h3>

<p>We have implemented some basic support for <a class="internal absent" href="/design-by-contract-in-Nemerle.html">Design_by_contract_macros</a>.&#xD;
It is based on macros modifying methods' and classes' contents to perform runtime checks of assertions specified by programmer.&#xD;</p>

<p>There are still many features missing in the implementation - the&#xD;
first idea is to extend it according to (or exceeding) the design of&#xD;
Spec#. The next step is to plug in some theorem-prover framework for&#xD;
checking those assertions statically (and making compiler signal errors&#xD;
about bugs detected in code). Possibly the tools used by SpecC# could&#xD;
be reused here (they check .NET binary assemblies), proving that the&#xD;
idea is language independent.&#xD;</p>

<p><b>Time estimate</b>: about 1,5 week for extending the existing implementation to generate more runtime checks; 2 weeks to 1 month for incorporating theorem prover tools in static checking&#xD;</p>

<p><b>Requirements</b>: for extending the assertion macros just a curiosity&#xD;
for new ideas is needed and ability to learn how to use macros, for using&#xD;
theorem prover - ability to communicate with Spec# folks and exploring&#xD;
the possibilities of plugging together tools, which were not specifically&#xD;
designed for it&#xD;</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Traits"><a name="Traits" id="Traits">Traits</a></span></h3>

<p>Implement <a class="internal present" href="/Traits.html">traits</a>.&#xD;</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Projects_being_worked_on"><a name="Projects_being_worked_on" id="Projects_being_worked_on">Projects being worked on</a></span></h2>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Pythonlike_syntax_frontend"><a name="Pythonlike_syntax_frontend" id="Pythonlike_syntax_frontend">Python-like syntax front-end</a></span></h3>

<p>Nemerle syntax is curly-braces based. We would like a compiler option to make&#xD;
the syntax indentation-sensitive. This can be rather easily done at the lexer.&#xD;
Please refer to <a class="internal present" href="/Indentation-based-syntax.html">indentation-based syntax</a> for more info.&#xD;</p>

<p>The second part of this project is to make the semantics closer to one used&#xD;
by Python -- for example drop <code>def</code> for definition, and use plain&#xD;
assignments. This requires some creativity and good knowledge of Python.&#xD;</p>

<p><b>Time estimate</b>: 1 week for the first part, 1 week up to 2 months for the second&#xD;
depending on how much you want to have done.&#xD;</p>

<p><b>Requirements</b>: Python experience; at least moderate ability to dive&#xD;
into existing Nemerle code base.&#xD;</p>

<p><b>Status</b>: Ellis Whitehead is developing an indentation based parser front-end. We are planning to include it as optionally enabled feature in main compiler. We didn't yet think about semantic changes, but this will probably find its way to the users (either through hardcoded compiler options or by loadable macros). &#xD;</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Aspectoriented_programming"><a name="Aspectoriented_programming" id="Aspectoriented_programming">Aspect-oriented programming</a></span></h3>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming">AOP</a> is a methodology of dividing project design into separate concerns that overlap in funcionality as little as possible. It is accomplished using specially designed aspect-oriented languages, which give the framework for defining aspects, specifying how they should be merged into the final program and compiling such specification into a working executable.&#xD;</p>

<p>In Nemerle we have a more general and low-level approach to the problem of modifying code - <a class="internal present" href="/Macros.html">macros</a>. &#xD;
They allow generating, analysing and transforming code, as well as traversing the object hierarchy of program (enumerating existing classes, their members, modifying methods' bodies, etc.).&#xD;</p>

<p>The idea is to implement the AOP design using macros as a compiler extensibility framework. The possible plan of action:&#xD;</p>

<ul><li> identify and create a language for specifying aspects, pointcuts, advices (the standard shape of class can be used - by utilizing the attribute macros it can be transformed and interpreted as apect)&#xD;
</li><li> identify the needed modifications of the compiler API (for example making a field reference as join-point would require extending compiler to insert some code at every use of given field)&#xD;
</li><li> implement the aspects weaving &#xD;
</li></ul><b>Time estimate</b>: 2 weeks or more depending on the knowledge of AOP and set of features to be implemented&#xD;

<p><b>Requirements</b>: moderate knowledge of AOP ideas and/or some aspect-oriented language (like AspectJ), desire to try out possibilities of macros and ability to modify some compler API and code (with help of core team)&#xD;</p>

<p><b>Status</b>: Kamil Dworakowski has <a target="_blank" href="http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.nemerle.devel/829">declared</a> to work on AOP framework.&#xD;</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="XML_macros"><a name="XML_macros" id="XML_macros">XML macros</a></span></h3>

<p>It is possible to implement macros for creating and matching over&#xD;
XML much like in &#xD;
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/papers/xtatic-runtime-CC.pdf">Xtatic</a>.&#xD;
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/papers/xtatic.tgz">Compiler sources</a>&#xD;
in OCaml are also available.&#xD;</p>

<p>Probably we would need a special XML class in the library as described in&#xD;
the paper. Of course conversion between that implementation and System.Xml&#xD;
classes need to be provided.&#xD;</p>

<p>We are not very interested in static typing of XML. The most important&#xD;
thing is to develop some practical and usable mechanisms for operating&#xD;
on XML.&#xD;</p>

<p>It is not required to base this project on Xtatic, but it's clearly&#xD;
required to read about it.&#xD;</p>

<p><b>Time estimate</b>: 1 week to 1 month depending on how much you would&#xD;
like to have done.&#xD;</p>

<p><b>Requirements</b>: knowledge about XML, XPath and related stuff,&#xD;
knowledge and/or ability to learn about Nemerle macros.&#xD;</p>

<p><b>Status</b>: Piotr Kalinowski has declared to work on it.</p>
